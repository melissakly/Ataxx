# Ataxx
Ataxx is a two-person game played with red and blue pieces on a 7-by-7 board. There are two possible kinds of move: you can extend from a piece of your own color by laying down a new piece of your color in an empty square next to that existing piece (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or you can jump: move a piece of your own color to an empty, non-adjacent square that is no more than two rows and no more than two columns distant. In either case, all opposing pieces that are next to the previously empty destination square are replaced by pieces of your color.

This project includes an option for manual players and an automated player (AI for short). The AI is implemented through an alpha-beta pruning search algoirthm.
